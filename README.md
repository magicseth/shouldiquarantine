## Project setup

This project uses Vue and Firebase and Node.  It will probably use Vuex soon

To get your development environment ready,

1) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1) Install [vue cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
2) cd vueshouldiquarantine
3) npm install
5) npm run serve

Now you are running live locally

The fun files to edit are HelloVue.vue and Question.vue

### Deploy
I believe in committing production files to the repo.

They get deployed when you push a new commit to master with the dist/ files udpated.

To deploy:

```
npm run build
```

then git push
